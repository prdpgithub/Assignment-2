    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Ans.  There are two Boolean. values: True and False. Values in Python can be compared using comparison operations, and Boolean logic can be formulated with the use of logic operations.  Boolean expressions use relational or comparison and logical operators. The result of a Boolean expression is either true or false.\n"
